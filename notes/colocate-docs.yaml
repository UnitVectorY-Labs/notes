title: Colocate Docs With Code
thesis: Colocate your documentation with your source code in the git repository.
bullets:
  - Documentation that lives with code is versioned, reviewed, and shipped together.
  - Separating docs from source guarantees drift as it changes.
  - Changes that affect users or operators should update docs in the same pull request.
  - AI coding agents can read and update documentation automatically when it lives alongside the code they modify.
example: "A service repository that includes a README and /docs directory, updated in the same commit as an API change, ensures documentation always matches the deployed version."
