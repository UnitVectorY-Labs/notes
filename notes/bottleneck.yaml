title: Bottleneck First
thesis: Don't waste your time. Improvements made anywhere other than the bottleneck rarely change the outcome.
quote: "Any improvement made anywhere besides the bottleneck is an illusion."
bullets:
  - Identify the constraint with data, not debate.
  - Increase throughput at the constraint before optimizing anything else.
  - If the bottleneck moves, repeat the process.
example: "Rule of thumb: if a change doesn't increase throughput at the constraint, treat it as cosmetic."
