title: Complete or Credit
thesis: When facing outside resistance to a task, ask a simple question: do you want the outcome, or do you want recognition for your accomplishment? The answer should guide how public, formal, and political your approach needs to be.
quote: "Do you want something done, or do you want credit for your work?"
bullets:
  - Decide whether success is the outcome you want or the recognition attached to it.
  - Quiet execution often moves faster.
  - Public execution invites review, alignment, and interference but establishes ownership.
  - Quiet execution carries the risk that someone else receives the credit.
