title: POC vs MVP
thesis: A POC cuts corners but not scope. An MVP cuts scope but not corners.
bullets:
  - A proof of concept exists to answer a single question: can this work at all?
  - POCs preserve scope just enough to validate feasibility, while allowing poor structure, hacks, and shortcuts.
  - A minimum viable product exists to deliver real value to real users.
  - MVPs aggressively reduce scope, but the code must be correct, maintainable, and safe to evolve.
  - Technical debt is acceptable in a POC and dangerous in an MVP.
example: "A prototype with hardcoded data and no tests may be acceptable as a POC, but an MVP would ship only one workflow end to end with proper error handling, tests, and deployability."
