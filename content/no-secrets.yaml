title: Eliminate Long Lived Secrets
thesis: "The goal shouldn’t be to secure secrets, it should be to not need them at all. If your application depends on long lived credentials you’ve already failed."
quote: "The most secure secret is the one you never have to manage."
bullets:
  - Long lived static credentials inevitably leak through repos, logs, CI/CD configs, and backups and become persistent risk.
  - On AWS, assign IAM roles to compute identities so services call AWS APIs without ever storing access keys.
  - On GCP, attach service accounts to resources so workloads access cloud APIs with short lived tokens instead of keys.
  - In Kubernetes, leverage workload identity so pods authenticate to cloud or internal services without secrets.
  - Strive to eliminate all long lived secrets from your application and infrastructure. While it may not be possible to remove every secret, this is your north star.
example: "A compute workload is granted an identity by the platform and reads objects from a storage bucket using short lived credentials issued at runtime, with no API keys or secrets stored in code, config, or environment variables."
