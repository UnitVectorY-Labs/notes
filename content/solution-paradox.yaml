title: The Solution Paradox
thesis: Most solutions create new problems. Be thoughtful before adding complexity.
bullets:
  - "Every fix carries tradeoffs: new failure modes, new dependencies, and new things to operate."
  - Choose the simplest thing that solves the problem, but no simpler. Then revisit only when constraints change.
  - "Treat complexity as a cost you must keep paying: testing, docs, on-call, upgrades, and hiring."
example: "Example: Moving to Kubernetes can improve reliability and scaling, but it also adds operational overhead (clusters, controllers, RBAC, networking), a larger failure surface area, and new classes of bugs like misconfigured resources and noisy neighbor issues."
