title: Prefer Data Driven Tests
thesis: Tests should be defined by data, not logic. Structure test cases around inputs, system state, and expected outcomes using data files (ex: JSON, YAML, XML) so the test code itself stays fixed and simple and new tests can be added by simply adding new data entries.
bullets:
  - A data driven approach separates inputs, test state, and expected results into structured data files rather than embedding them in code. This makes each case clear, reviewable, and explicit.
  - Keeping test code mostly fixed while driving variation from data reduces duplication and maintenance. When behavior changes the output, you update your test data sets, not logic within tests.
  - Adding a new scenario should mean simply adding a new data row or entry, not another test function in code. If you find a new big or edge case, simply add a new data entry to cover it without writing any new code.
  - Utilize parameterized tests in your language of choice to retain separate test cases for each data entry while reusing the same test logic.
example: "A test runner loads a JSON or YAML file listing request payloads, initial state conditions, and expected results, then loops over each entry with one implementation of the test logic to validate behavior across scenarios."
