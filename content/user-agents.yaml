title: Name Your HTTP Clients
thesis: Always use a descriptive User-Agent when making HTTP requests. This helps with observability, debugging, and understanding traffic patterns even when authentication fails.
bullets:
  - Include app name, version, environment, and region.
  - Keep it stable so you can grep it in logs and dashboards.
  - Add a request id separately; do not overload the User-Agent.
example: "User-Agent: myservice/1.7.3 (env=prod; region=us-east-1)"
