title: Focus on the Bottleneck
thesis: Don't waste your time optimizing non-constraints. Improvements made anywhere other than the bottleneck are a waste of effort.
quote: "Any improvement made anywhere besides the bottleneck is an illusion."
bullets:
  - Identify the constraint with data, not debate.
  - Increase throughput at the constraint before optimizing anything else. Verify with data.
  - If the bottleneck moves, and it will, repeat the process as necessary.
example: "Rule of thumb: if a change doesn't increase throughput at the constraint, treat it as cosmetic."
